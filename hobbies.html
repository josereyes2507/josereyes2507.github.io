  <p> I enjoy hanging out with friends and playing videogames. However, during my free time I find myself
    shooting photography, playing the guitar or mixing songs on my DJ Controller. When it's nice out I
    Skateboard and longboard around with my friends as I find it peaceful. People will describe me as
    a music addict because I spend so much time finding new alternative & indie music, but recently it feels
    like I have listened to all of them.
